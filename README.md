how to save trees
Trees are an integral part of our planet. They clean the air that we breathe, help remove pollutants, and provide lovely shade on a hot summer day. In fact, they’re so essential to life on Earth that merely living close to trees makes human beings healthier and happier.[1] If you want to save trees, rest assured that you don’t have to go out planting hundreds of trees to make a difference. Making a few minor lifestyle changes may not seem like a lot, but you’re sure to help make the planet a better place.
